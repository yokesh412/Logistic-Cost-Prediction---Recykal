# Logistic-Cost-Prediction---Recykal

A logistic cost prediction project aims to predict the cost of logistics operations, such as shipping and transportation of goods, based on various factors such as the distance, mode of transportation, type and weight of goods, fuel prices, and other relevant factors. The goal of this project is to provide a realistic estimate of the cost of logistics operations, which can help businesses make informed decisions about their supply chain and logistics strategies.

The project typically involves collecting and analyzing data on various aspects of logistics operations, such as shipping routes, fuel prices, and types of goods being transported. This data is then used to build a predictive model that takes into account the various factors that influence the cost of logistics operations. The model is trained using machine learning algorithms to make accurate predictions based on historical data.

Once the model is built and tested, it can be used to make cost predictions for new logistics operations. This can help businesses make informed decisions about their supply chain and logistics strategies, and optimize their operations for maximum efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
